# google-cloud-endpoints-client

This is a CocoaPod of the [GTL Client library](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/) that is used in Google Cloud Endpoint's generated client code. This is basically a way to automate [this](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/endpoints/consume_ios#Python_Adding_required_files_to_your_iOS_project) step in the Google Cloud Endpoints setup process.

I hope this makes your life a little easier!
